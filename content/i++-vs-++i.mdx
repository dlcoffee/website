This one always trips me up. If the `++` increment is _after_ the operand, then
it's called a **post increment** (`i++`). If the `++` is _before_ the operand,
then it's called a **pre increment** (`++i`).

With the **post increment**, the value gets incremented by one, and returns
the _original_ value.

```javascript linenos
let i = 2
let j = i++

console.log({ i, j })
// { i: 3, j: 2 }
```

With the **pre increment**, the value gets incremented by one, and returns
the _new_ value.

```javascript linenos
let i = 2
let j = ++i

console.log({ i, j })
// { i: 3, j: 3 }
```

They're commonly seen in `for-loop`s where it generally doesn't matter which
one is used.

```javascript linenos
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i) // outputs 0, 1, 2
}

for (let j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
  console.log(j) // outputs 0, 1, 2
}
```
