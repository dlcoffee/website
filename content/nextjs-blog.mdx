I decided that my personal website needed some attention and wanted it to be
a bit more reflective of who I am in 2021. I no longer work with rails
or angularjs on a daily basis. For the past couple of years, I have been
doing node and javascript development.

With that said, I no longer felt that a website built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
was interesting to me. I was no longer thinking in ruby, the dependencies were out
of date, and I prefer to write my blog posts in markdown.

I work on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications at work, and decided it would
be fun to use it for my new website.

## Approach

I didn't want to deal with long standing branch in the old repo, so I ended
up creating a new repo, freshly init with `npx create-next-app`

I knew that I didn't want to migrate everything over at once. I'm a fan of
incremental progress, so my goal was to pick and choose portions of my
website to port over one at a time.

Once I got to as close to parity as possible, I could start to think about new
features. I didn't want to get ahead of myself.

## How

I started off with the basic Next.js starter app and deployed that
on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I wanted to deploy early and often.

The next thing I wanted to get out of the way was figuring out how to handle
the icons for the footer. I had used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
for my previous website, which worked by adding a `<script>` tag and
using the correct `fa` css classes. I browsed their website to see if there
was an updated approach with React in mind, and I found they had an official
React component: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react

It was pretty straightforward from their docs on how to use the components.
I just needed to import the few icons I needed and added them to the `library`
from my `_app.js` component.

```javascript
// _app.js

import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { faGithub } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons'

library.add(faGithub)
```

In my `<Footer>` component,

```jsx
// Footer.js

import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'

const Footer = () => {
  return (
    <a href="https://github.com/dlcoffee" title="github">
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={['fab', 'github']} size="2x" />
    </a>
  )
}
```

One of my requirements for the new website was that I wanted to be able to write my blog posts
in markdown and be able to import React components. Luckily, there's
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which allows me to write JSX in markdown.

I had heard of MDX before, but I had never worked with it. This proved to a bit
more work than I had anticipated. In order to get MDX working the way I wanted,
I needed to:

1. Install MDX packages
2. Convert existing blog posts to markdown
3. Figure out how to dynamically generate blog posts + urls
4. Figure out how to use front matter
5. Figure out how to handle excerpts

Installing MDX pretty straightforward and converting the _text_ content of my
blog posts was also easy.

I didn't want create a new page under the `/pages` directory for each blog post,
so I utilized a combination of Next's `getStaticPaths()` and `getStaticProps()`
functions along with another library called [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
which allowed me to pull in mdx content through `getStaticProps()`

- `getStaticPaths()` - Specifies **dynamic routes** based on data. I use the name
  of the post to generate the url slug.
- `getStaticProps()` - Pulls the correct markdown data to parse based on the slug

```jsx
// pages/blog/[slug].js

import hydrate from 'next-mdx-remote/hydrate'
import { getFiles, getFileBySlug } from '../../lib/mdx'

export default function Post({ source }) {
  const content = hydrate(source)
  return <div className="wrapper">{content}</div>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getFiles()

  return {
    paths: posts.map((p) => ({
      params: {
        slug: p.replace(/\.mdx/, ''),
      },
    })),
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { mdxSource } = await getFileBySlug(params.slug)

  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

Once my blog posts were written in `.mdx` and I could get them loaded
dynamically, I worked on getting the layout and colors set up correctly.
This part wasn't too difficult, as I decided to use `Sass` again, as it
was almost a straight copy/paste from my old repo.

Lastly, for me to feel comfortable switching over to the new website, I
needed to get my syntax highlighting and embedded scripts to work as before,
since I have a code snippets and codepen examples to show.

For this, I used a library called [`prism-react-renderer`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer),
, which allowed me to use a component to output syntax-highlighted code. In combination with MDX,
this allowed me to reach a level of parity that I was comfortable with. The theme
was off, but I decided not to make it a blocker for getting the new website up.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project. I kept track of my todo's in an app called [Todoist](https://todoist.com/),
which kept me focused on the to-do at hand. There are still some fixes that I need to make,
like getting the excerpts to show up correctly on the home page, but I'll fix it some
other time.

I'm hoping to write more now that I'm able to use markdown.
