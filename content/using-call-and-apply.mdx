In JavaScript, functions are just objects. This means that you can attach functions to them,
just as you can with any other object. Some defaults that come along with being a function are
`.toString()`, `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()`. We're going to tkae a closer look at two similar, but slightly different methods: `call()` and `apply()`.

### TL;DR

- both methods invoke the function caller, using a context passed in as the first parameter
- `call` takes a `this` context, and the arguments are passed with **commas**
- `apply` takes a `this` context, and the arguments are passed as an **Array**

### Why use either?

Using `call` or `apply` are ways to re-use some functionality.
They provide us a way to _borrow_ functions, so we can avoid code duplication.
With either method, you can execute the function with a modified `this` context.
When a function is called normally, it's `this` value is set normally (either the containing
object or the global object).

```javascript
var obj = { value: 10 }

function addToThis(x) {
  return this.value + x // `this` refers to the global object
}

console.log(addToThis(5)) // undefined, because `this.value` is undefined

// `call` or `apply` modifies the `this` context
console.log(addToThis.call(obj, 5)) // 15
console.log(addToThis.apply(obj, [5])) // 15
```

### Choosing one over the other

`call` is a good choice when the arguments for a function are known.

```javascript
var robert = {
  name: 'robert',
  greeting: function () {
    return 'my name is ' + this.name
  },
}

var robot = {
  name: 'ROB',
}

console.log(robert.greeting()) // 'my name is robert'
console.log(robert.greeting.call(robot)) // 'my name is ROB'
```

`apply` is a good choice when the function has an unknown amount of arguments.
You can deconstruct the arguments yourself, and do whatever is necessary.

```javascript
var robert = {
  name: 'robert',
  greeting: function () {
    var foodsArray = []
    var foodsStr

    for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      foodsArray.push(arguments[i])
    }

    // insert oxford comma if necessary
    var length = foodsArray.length
    if (length === 1) {
      foodsStr = foodsArray[0]
    } else if (length == 2) {
      foodsStr = foodsArray.join(' and ')
    } else if (length > 2) {
      foodsArray[length - 1] = 'and ' + foodsArray[length - 1]
      foodsStr = foodsArray.join(', ')
    }

    return 'my name is ' + this.name + ', and i like to eat ' + foodsStr
  },
}

var robot = {
  name: 'ROB',
}

console.log(robert.greeting('pizza', 'hot dogs'))
// 'my name is robert, and i like to eat pizza and hot dogs'

console.log(robert.greeting.apply(robot, ['waffles', 'metal', 'humans']))
// 'my name is ROB, and i like to eat waffles, metal, and humans'
```

Note that I'm using a special JavaScript object here: `arguments`.
`arguments` gives us access to all parameters passed in, specified or not.
The `robert.greeting` method does not take any parameters, but we're still able to call it with a variable amount of parameters.
It's important to also note that that although `arguments` has a `length` method, it is **not** an Array.

Using this knowledge, we can be clever about our usage of `apply` and use it to our advantage on some built-in JavaScript functions.
Take `Math.max()`, for example. `Math.max()` takes arguments as comma separated values, and returns the max value.
If we gave it an array, we'd get `NaN`, because an Array can't be converted into a number for the function.
Instead, we can use `apply` in this form:

```javascript
var numbers = [5, 3, 12, 1]

console.log(Math.max(numbers)) // NaN

// this translates to:
// Math.max(numbers[0], numbers[1], ...);
console.log(Math.max.apply(null, numbers)) // 12
```

Here, we don't need to invoke `Math.max` with any specific `this`.
We just want to call the method using an array.
With `apply()`, we can do just that, and avoid writing our own version of `max()` for arrays.
