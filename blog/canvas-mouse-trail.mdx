I came across an interesting interaction that reminded me of the older web the other day. As a user
moved their mouse cursor around, there would be a trail of _something_ that followed it. I was intrigued
and wanted to see how/what it worked, so I opened up the dev console for the website
([Synchronized Digital Studio][synchronized-ds]) and after poking around a bit, I realized that it wasn't
just a plain old `<div>` that had some special handling. It was `<canvas>`, which I had never worked
with before.

Using a combination of `<canvas>` and `requestAnimationFrame()`, I was able to recreate the interaction.

The idea is to attach an event listener for mouse movement to add a new `Point` to an array that
holds the position of the user's movement.

```javascript
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

class Point {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x
    this.y = y
    this.timestamp = 0
  }
}

const points = []

const addPoint = (x, y) => {
  const point = new Point(x, y)
  points.push(point)
}

document.addEventListener('mousemove', ({ clientX, clientY }) => {
  addPoint(clientX - canvas.offsetLeft, clientY - canvas.offsetTop)
})
```

Next, using `requestAnimationFrame`, on each frame, clear the canvas, loop over each
`point` and either

1. Remove the point if enough time has passed (`maxAgeMS`)
2. Draw the point and connect it to the previous `point`

```javascript
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height)

const maxAgeMS = 160

for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
  const currentPoint = points[i]
  let previousPoint

  if (points[i - 1] !== undefined) {
    previousPoint = points[i - 1]
  } else {
    previousPoint = currentPoint
  }

  if (!currentPoint.timestamp) {
    currentPoint.timestamp = timestamp
  }

  const elapsed = timestamp - currentPoint.timestamp

  if (elapsed > maxAgeMS) {
    points.shift()
  } else {
    ctx.lineJoin = 'round'
    ctx.lineWidth = 4

    ctx.strokeStyle = `rgb(152,236,60)`

    ctx.beginPath()

    ctx.moveTo(previousPoint.x, previousPoint.y)
    ctx.lineTo(currentPoint.x, currentPoint.y)

    ctx.stroke()
    ctx.closePath()
  }
}
```

Rinse and repeat for each frame, and this is what I ended up with:
