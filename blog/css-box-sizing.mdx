The `box-sizing` property is used to tell the browser how to calculate the width and height of an element. By default, this is set to `content-box`, which may cause some unexpected behavior for someone new to CSS.

`content-box` tells the browser:

- to calculate displayed `height`: use `height` + `padding` + `border`
- to calculate displayed `width`: use `width` + `padding` + `border`

So, if you set `height: 20px`, you're telling the browser that you want the **content** to have a height of 20px. It does not mean that it will get displayed at 20px. This can cause some issues with layout, especially if you have some fixed dimension containers. You could probably get by with calculating the correct `height` and `width` for your element manually, but who wants to do that?

### Enter: border-box

`border-box` is a way to tell the browser that when you set `height: 20px`, you want the rendered height to be `20px`.

{% include codepen.html hash="mWZmbV" title="box-sizing" %}

In this example, both divs contain similar styles.

{% highlight css %}
div {
width: 200px;
height: 200px;

margin: 20px;
padding: 10px;
border: 5px solid #FFE66D;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The difference is, the one on the left has `box-sizing: content-box;` and the one on the right has `box-sizing: border-box`. The CSS markup is telling the divs to have a height of `200px` and a width of `200px`. However, because of the `box-sizing` difference, they get rendered differently. The `content-box` gets rendered with `230px` (200 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5), while the `border-box` makes the content area smaller to account for a total width and height of `200px`. My suggestion is to use `border-box` for a more intuitive behavior and avoid unnecessary cognitive load to account for borders and paddings when using `content-box`.
