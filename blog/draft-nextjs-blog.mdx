I decided that my personal website needed some TLC and wanted it to be
a bit more reflective of who I am in 2021. I no longer work with ruby
or angularjs on a daily basis at work. I have been living in javascript
land for the past couple of years, and consider myself to know enough to
be dangerous with it.

With that said, I no longer felt that a website built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
was interesting to me. I was no longer thinking in ruby, the dependencies were out
of date, and I would've preferred to write my blog posts in markdown.
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) came up on the scene and I've been very interested
in the work that's been going on in this space, so I decided to migrate my blog to
it.

I work with Next.js applications daily at work, but I had never really explored
the "other" side of it, where I could utilize [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and static
page generation. The applications at work are behind authentication, so there
wasn't a real use case for statically generated pages.

## Approach

I didn't want to deal with long standing branch in the old repo, so I ended
up creating a new repo, freshly init with Next.js.

I knew that I didn't want to transport everything over at once. My goal
was to slowly get the new blog as close to 1:1 as possible before I
started to even think about new content and features.

## How

I started off just with the basic Next.js starter app and deployed that
on Vercel. I wanted to deploy early and often.

I then needed to figure out how to transfer the font icons from fontawseome
over for my footer. I had to do a bit of googling, because my old approach
was no longer working, and FA had been upgraded a few times.

Next, I wanted to get the basic content of my blogposts into markdown. I knew
about MDX, but I hadn't used it before. I had to learn how to connect
MDX and frontmatter together.

I tackled layout and colors next. I had to think in react (components).

I had to figure out excerpts. Luckily, there's a way to do it with gray matter.
Except it didn't handle formatting very well. Oh well, that's a ticket in
my todo list.

Syntax highlighting using prism.

## how

- used todoist for project tracking (first time)
- started off with basic nextjs deployment on vercel
- added new fontawseome, copy pasted sass styling
