- use nextjs a lot at work, but in a different way
- liked markdown, wanted to try out mdx
- wanted to try out new deployment strategies (vercel)
- wanted to get everything 1:1 first, then new design

## how

- started off with basic nextjs deployment on vercel
- added new fontawseome, copy pasted sass styling
- had to learn how to use mdx and how to generate pages
- added frontmatter
